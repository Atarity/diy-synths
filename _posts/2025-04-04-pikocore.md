Brother of the [Nyblcore](/synths/nyblcore/). Powered by AAA battery. Capable of holding 8 minutes of 8-bit 33 kHz monophonic samples. Tempo-synced with a selectable BPM between 60 and 300, with samples mangled by beat-synced effects (stutter, retrig, gate, tunneling). Loaded with real-time effects like a resonant filter, timestretching, volume, and wavefolding.

Sequenced with a 128-step sequencer with recording/playback
saved and loaded via EEPROM for instant patch recall. Sync-compatible with Pocket Operators.

> This design has no gerbers, nor pcb layouts published.
