description: "MIDI-compatible Sega Genesis/Megadrive synthesizer with real sound chips"
notes: "The Mega MIDI is not an emulator. This is the real deal. Both the genuine YM2612 and the SN76489 PSG sound chips are on-board. Further still, the patches are not recreated “sound-alikes” either. They are one-for-one instruments with identical settings to those found within their parent games. You are playing the actual patches on authentic hardware."
