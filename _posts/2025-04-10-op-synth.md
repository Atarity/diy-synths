Op-Synth designed to facilitate the understanding of electronics, audio synthesis, sound theory, and filtering. It teaches the basic principles of sound synthesis through a modular patch bay, just like a traditional modular analog synthesizer. It also features an LED that helps visualize the evolution of the sound signal, serving as a basic introduction to synesthesia.
