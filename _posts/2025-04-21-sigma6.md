Complex sound synthesizer comprising 6 oscillators, mixer, 3 envelope shapers, LFO with ramp, variable-gain attenuator (DCA), plus overdrive and reverberation effects. The firmware includes a diverse range of instrument sounds (presets). With two or more "Sigma-6" modules, you can play multi-part music using a MIDI sequencer.

Sound quality is excellent using a 12-bit DAC, 32kHz sample rate and 32-bit precision DSP computations. The tone-generator algorithm is immune to aliasing effects (except when overdrive is enabled).
