Hidden Sound Explorer (HSE) is a circuit that transduces the electromagnetic fields, produced by the electronic devices that surround us, into sounds to be listened to through earphones. It amplifies the electrical signal of a coil connected to the input, a two-pole connector. A piezoelectric disc (contact microphone) can also be connected to the input terminals to amplify micro-sounds that are normally inaudible.
