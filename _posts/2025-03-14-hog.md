Hog is a two-voice analog monophonic synthesizer with two oscillators. Itâ€™s also paraphonic playable via CV. It offers triangle, sawtooth, and square wave shapes. The latter also has a variable pulse width with a narrow option. The second voice also offers a +/- 1/2 octave and detune option for additional voice variation.
