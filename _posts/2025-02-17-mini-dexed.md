description: "FM synthesizer closely modeled on the famous DX7"
notes: "MiniDexed is a FM synthesizer closely modeled on the famous Yamaha DX7 running on a bare metal Raspberry Pi (without a Linux kernel or operating system). On Raspberry Pi 2 and newer, it can run 8 tone generators, not unlike the TX816/TX802. It is 8 DX7 instances without a keyboard in one box."
