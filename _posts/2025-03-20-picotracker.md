description: "Low cost music tracker platform"
notes: "picoTracker currently supports 8 monophonic 8Bit/16Bit/44.1KHz stereo channels as well as 16 channels midi output. It's firmware is essentially a modified version of LittleGPTracker, and keeps 90%+ of it's functionality. It implements a user interface similar to the refined track-by-joypad software littlesounddj."
