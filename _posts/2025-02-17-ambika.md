description: "Multi-voice, hybrid synthesizer. Descendant of Shruthi."
notes: "The sound generation is hybrid, combining the warmth and sonic character of a true 4-pole analog filter, with the large array of waveforms offered by digital wavetables, FM and phase modulation. The digital control of the analogue filter and VCA also means a very large palette of modulation possibilities."
