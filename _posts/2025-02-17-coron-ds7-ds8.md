The DS7 contain a VCO and VCA chain. The VCO is modulated by a cheesy LFO and a simple decay envelope trigged by the piezzo cell pulse. The cell work as a pressure/hit sensor. It can be replaced by a jack to be used with any kind of trig pulses or even gates. In this case the decay pot become a release pot.

There is lot's of clones available e.g.:
