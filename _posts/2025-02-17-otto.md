description: "Digital groovebox with synths, looper, samplers, effects and a sequencer"
notes: "The interface is flat, modular and easy to use, but most of all, it aims to encourage experimentation. The workflow is intended to be minimalistic with a minimum of menu-diving and everything at most a couple of intuitive button presses away."
