description: "Analog monosynth with a lo-fi digital drums"
notes: "Anushri is a monophonic synthesizer with an all-analog signal path, paired with a lo-fi digital drum synthesizer. These two sections are controlled by an on-board sequencer/arpeggiator, featuring generative drum pattern sequencing. Anushri is open to the modular world thanks to its analog patching area."
