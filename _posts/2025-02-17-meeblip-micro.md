Monophonic digital synthesizer built with through-hole components. It’s perfect for beginners who are just learning to solder. The PCB is so simple that there wasn’t even room for knobs or buttons — the device is entirely controlled via MIDI.

[Meeblip SE]({{site.baseurl}}/synths/meeblip-se) is quite the same synth with physical controls.
