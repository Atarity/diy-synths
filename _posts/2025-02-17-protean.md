Protean incorporates 3 independent CMOS-based (CD4000 series) sound generators for the production of a wide variety of sonic environments with an ever changing expressive vitality. The sound generators have complementary timbral characteristic covering all the frequency spectrum and may also be modulated (ATtiny45-based) by the two low frequency oscillators implemented in the circuit, generating hypnotic sounds which evolve over time.
