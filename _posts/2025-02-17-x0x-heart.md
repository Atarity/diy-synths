description: "Heart of the Roland TB-303, surgically extracted to be transplanted into your designs"
notes: "The x0x-heart is just the analog section of the TB-303, replicated with SMT components, and made small enough to fit into a Eurorack modular format. It even has a Eurorack power header on it, but normally you can use this design in any synth architecture."
