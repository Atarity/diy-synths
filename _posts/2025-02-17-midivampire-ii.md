description: "4 voice drum machine that is powered from the MIDI data line."
notes: "It has 2 wavetable voices for making kick drums, toms, wood blocks, bells, and a host of other sounds. There is a voice set aside for hi-hats and cymbals, and another which is a filtered noise source, which can make snares and hollow-tube sounds. Each voice has separate attack, decay, and release, along with frequency sweep, and a bunch of other effects for warping the sounds to fit all your percussive needs. And, there are independent outputs for each voice."
