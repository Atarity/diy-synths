Ilse is an elegantly minimal, yet fully functional synthesizer voice in a compact 10 HP Eurorack module. The only thing you need to let it meow is a CV source to trigger its 1V/Oct frequency input (or a MIDI to CV converter and a MIDI sequencer) . Because it has a low part count it is ideal for Eurorack beginners or entry-level DIY projects.

Ilse makes great acid sounds. Turn the knobs to make her look around or roll her eyes.

Ilse is designed to be affordable, easy to build, yet flexible, and feature rich. It is a synthesizer voice for your Eurorack, but can even be driven without a rack using two 9V batteries (not included).

Ilse is fully open source (KiCad schematic and layout is available in a git repository) and inspired by Syntherjackâ€™s single-chip synthesizer Totoro. Check out his website with nice explanations, e.g. on the filter (we use the same filter on Ilse). We extended the design for external voltage control on filter, oscillators and LFO. Unlike Totoro, Ilse is designed around a unique oscillator design, which integrates the exponential conversion directly into the oscillator core. This results in an efficient circuitry saving you build time, parts and costs.
