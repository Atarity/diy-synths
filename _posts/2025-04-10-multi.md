You can program your multi as you need, using the Arduino IDE. On the MIDI side, possible use includes advanced midi controlling, filtering and remapping as well as algorithmic arpeggiators and aleatoric patch generators. It's also perfect to explore digital synthesis techniques.

There are already several usable software and the list is constantly expanding:
- **synth sequencer** three oscillators monophonic synth with embedded sequencer. It receives MIDI clock and note messages
- **drone** it's a six oscillators drone machine
- **euclidean sequencer** receives midi clock, start/stop on the MIDI DIN input, generates euclidean rhythms on the MIDI DIN output
- **bytebeat player** allows to play algorithmic music with no instruments and no real oscillators but a math expression that creates an audio output waveform as a function of time, processed 8000 times per second. The expression has six parameters accessible through the multi knobs
- **fourier** 3 voices drone generator, each voice is composed by six oscillators tuned on the harmonic overtones, each voice has six lfos
- **cc scrambler** generates random synthesizer patch by spitting out random MIDI CC values (preset fucker)
- **multimode** keep pressed PB1 and PB2 to choose the mode between: synth sequencer, drone, euclidean sequencer, bytebeat player, fourier and cc scrambler
- **midi converter** is a USB to 5 DIN bi-directional MIDI converter
- **midi metronome** takes the MIDI clock from the 5 DIN midi connector and generates a metronome click on the audio output, to allow acoustic musicians to synchronize their performance to an electronic setup
- **fm** a simple fm synth
