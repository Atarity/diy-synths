description: "Hackable monophonic synth based on atmega32"
notes: "Meeblip Triode's huge sound is driven by three oscillators and a unique twin-T analog lowpass filter. Two digital pulse/pwm/sawtooth oscillators can be detuned and a square wave sub-oscillator adds to the bottom end. For sonic variety, triode also offers hands-on access to 24 grungy wavetables, along with dual envelopes routed to oscillator amplitude and filter cutoff for powerful filter sweeps and effects."
