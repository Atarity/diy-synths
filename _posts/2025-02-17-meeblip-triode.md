Meeblip Triode's huge sound is driven by three oscillators and a unique twin-T analog lowpass filter. Two digital pulse/pwm/sawtooth oscillators can be detuned and a square wave sub-oscillator adds to the bottom end. For sonic variety, triode also offers hands-on access to 24 grungy wavetables, along with dual envelopes routed to oscillator amplitude and filter cutoff for powerful filter sweeps and effects.

There is more docs on operation and DIY topics in [Meeblip support page](https://meeblip.com/pages/support).
