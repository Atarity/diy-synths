Device uses a Hex Schmitt-trigger (40106be) for pulses (lfo/osc), a binary ripple counter (4040) for sequencing and an XR 2206 for FM and AM audio. And (very) primitive filters. It sequences using the binary ripple counter, mashed.

The XR features 2 FM inputs and one AM input. The waveshape of the XR can be tuned from brash triangle to simple sine. The XOR is providing on LFO pulse and one square wave OSC.
