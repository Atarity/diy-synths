description: "Full-fledged voice module with two specular Benjolins at its core"
notes: "The Benjolin designed by Rob Hordijk in 2009, was a a kit to be built in educational workshops to promote synth DIY. The idea is that people can build a medium complexity electronic circuit in a controlled environment and box it later at home."

Featuring two oscillators, a resonant filter, and a chaotic voltage generator, the Benjolin presents a sonic palette that transcends traditional synthesis parameters, beckoning users to embark on explorations of untrodden sonic landscapes. Its output, while unpredictable and frequently oscillating between harmonious and discordant, presents both a challenge and inspiration.
