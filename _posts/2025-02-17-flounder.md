Teensy4-based USB MIDI device with number of different firmwares.

- 12 MIDI mappable potentiometers
- full octave touch keyboard
- 6 touch function buttons
- stereo audio output
- runs on Teensy 4.0 / fully reprogrammable
- conceived as a friend of [Norns]({{site.baseurl}}/synths/norns-shield) but works with anything that supports MIDI over USB
