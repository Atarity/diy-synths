A device powered by a single AAA battery and holding 8 kB of storage for up to 1.2 seconds of 8-bit audio sampled @ 4.1 kHz. Controlled by multi-functional knobs that modulate tempo, volume, distortion. Probability-based knobs also control the chaos of jump, retrig, stutter and stretch fx.

Able to load custom firmware/audio using an Arduino or an AVR usb programmer with web-based tool.
