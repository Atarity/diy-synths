The Zeptocore featuring stereo playback of 16-bit audio files at a 44.1 kHz sampling rate. It supports SD-card storage for up to 32 gigabytes of samples and can recall up to 256 audio files organized into 16 banks of 16 tracks each. It has 16 different audio effects â€” saturation, fuzz, delay, comb, beat repeater, filter, tape stop, reverb + more, and includes a single-cycle wavetable synthesizer.

The device offers a real-time sequencer with optional quantization, optional clock sync out, and MIDI (in and out) over USB. The device has a built-in 8-ohm speaker and can be powered by two AAA batteries or USB-C.

There is [Zeptoboard version](https://zeptocore.com/#zeptoboard) of the device. It can be assembled easily with breadboard and some off-the-shelf components.

> This design has no gerbers, nor pcb layouts published.
