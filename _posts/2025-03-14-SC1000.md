The SC1000 loads samples and beats from a USB stick. At less than the size of three stacked DVD cases, it’s probably the smallest integrated portablist solution ever. Despite this, the software and hardware have been carefully tuned and optimized, and it’s responsive enough for even the most complex scratch patterns.

This device is based on Olimex SoM and runs Linux while having additional PIC MCU for input handling. Check the video to better understand project complexity.
