2 tracks of Roland TB-303 sequencer with 14 non-volatile pattern memory slots to save your work. Programming using rest, tie, glide and accent on each step. The addition of step length parameter per track makes you able to choose from 1 step to 16 steps of pattern length to make some unusual sequences.

Generate automatic harmonized acid lines by pressing a single button and twist some harmonic parameter knobs.

There is also V2 available in the same repo.
