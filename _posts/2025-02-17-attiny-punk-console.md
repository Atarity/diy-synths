The ATtiny Punk Console (ATPC) is a programmable 8-bit mini synthesizer. From Noise Toy, over Drum Sound Generator, Atari Punk Console to Drone Generator â€” everything is possible! Short audio sequences can be used to upload new synth programs via smartphone or PC to remap the 4 potentiometers. Own codes can be programmed via the Arduino IDE.
