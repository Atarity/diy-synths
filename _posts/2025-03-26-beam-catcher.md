A 12 oscillator, gestural, light-based synthesizer. Each oscillator is a square wave with a tuning trimmer, with a range of roughly 14Hz to >10KHz. The output is 3.5mm stereo and works with headphones, there are two 3.5mm mono connections to plug aux cords in to connect with the sensors. The unit runs off of standard USB-C.
