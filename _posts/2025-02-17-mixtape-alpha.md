description: "Credit-card sized Atmega328 4 voice synth"
notes: "It has a stylophone style input for continuous note generation, and 6 touch buttons for discrete notes. With 4 voices, 4 effects, and 5 note polyphony there is quite a range of expression. But, the best part is, you can record the songs you make, and trade mixtapes with your friends! Perhaps even better, itâ€™s based on the Atmega328, and can be hacked to make even crazier sounds than we came up with."
