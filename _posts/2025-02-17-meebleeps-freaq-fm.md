description: "Dual-voice, 2 operator 8-bit FM Arduino Synth in Volca form-factor"
notes: "Features dual independent 2-operator FM voices paired with a 2-track generative sequencer. Each voice has independent carrier & modulator waveforms, FM ratio, modulation envelope & LFO. Both tracks share the a single pattern (inspired by the Intellijel Metropolix) and can be stacked in unison or have different polymetric step-counts. Track 1 can be offset 0-3 octaves above track 2 for separate bass & lead."
