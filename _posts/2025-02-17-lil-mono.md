description: "Simple east-coast style analog synthesizer"
notes: "The Lil' Mono Synth is a very simple east coast style analog synthesizer. It is quite limited compared to commercial synths but it is a fun little device that sounds dirty and quite lofi. It contains a sawtooth wave VCO that tracks V/Oct, a square wave sub-oscillator, a simple and dirty sounding resonant VCF, a VCA and an attack/release envelope generator that can modulate the amplitude and the filter cut-off frequency."
