Battery powered, double ATtiny85 synth with complex oscillators and 3 synth engines.

The oscillator section has 3 sound parameters: pitch, timbre, and waveshape â€” all under voltage control, offering 6 different synthesis modes. It has a main output and a secondary waveform output. Both can be used independently or in combination.

There is number of different firmwares in the repo. They are Arduino compatible.

> This design has no gerbers, nor pcb layouts published while have layout in pdf.
