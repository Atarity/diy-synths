description: "Simple, full analog noise synth"
notes: "The MFOS Noise Toaster circuit consists of seven main components: a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), a white noise generator, a voltage controlled low pass filter (VCF), a low frequency oscillator (LFO), a simple AR envelope generator (AREG), a simple voltage controlled amplifier (VCA), and a one watt amplifier that drives a small speaker. The unit is powered by one nine volt battery and due to the low current drain of the LM324 (Lo-Power Quad Op Amp) it gets a lot of miles out of a nine volt battery."
