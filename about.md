Hey, I'm [Misha](https://github.com/Atarity) ðŸ‘‹. I have quite a bit of experience building open-source synthesizers based on schematics found in the depths of the internet. I created this site to compile dozens of open-source designs into kind a database, making it easier for anyone looking to build their first synthesizer to choose a suitable project without additional research.

The list is constantly expanding with projects that I curate. If a project is listed on the site, it doesn't necessarily mean I've built it (though I've assembled more than two dozen of them), but it does mean I've verified that all the necessary build files are available, published by their authors, and accessible to everyone.

>Search, sort, check video. Find your next weekend project. Have fun!

## Updates and RSS
The best way to stay updated is to subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml). If you're a GitHub rat, you can also follow the [repository](https://github.com/Atarity/diy-synths) updates.

## Why project "X" not in the list?
The minimum criteria for adding to the database are:
- The project must have published schematics. For simple synths hand-drawn schematics, or Fritzring-like is ok.
- For digital devices with a microcontroller, a firmware source code must be available.
- Video demonstration is a must.

You can find some of the projects was checked but not in the list due to different reasons. I'm trying to track such a projects on the [Watchlist page](/watchlist).

Not all projects in the database are synthesizers: there are also arpeggiators, sequencers, MIDI controllers, and more. Almost all devices are **standalone** units, meaning they have their own power supply and donâ€™t require external control voltage to function.

## How to submit a design?
Write about it in the repo [discussions](https://github.com/Atarity/diy-synths/discussions). Or make a [repo](https://github.com/Atarity/diy-synths) fork, create a file in the `_posts/` directory then submit a PR. Maybe I'll make a form for submission later. But not today ðŸ˜€.

## How to report a mistake or suggest an edit?
[Create an issue](https://github.com/Atarity/diy-synths/issues), or submit a PR right away if you're confident.
